Through repetitive and unfruitful use, we’re truly and surely bored of our ‘diplomatic’ effort of saving the earth. We’ve thought about reducing carbon footprints, we’ve Googled about renewable energy sources, some of us even pondered at the thought of replacing his Motorcycle with an e-bike!</p>\n<p>We all wait for a better tomorrow. But there will be no better tomorrow if there is no better ‘us’. Can we change the world? No chance. But we can save the surrounding we’re in. We can easily keep it clean. We can easily switch our 4 wheeler for a bicycle, for the ride to work, everyday. We can easily save our mountains, rivers, countrysides from having the same fate of our cities.</p>\n<p>We leave the ‘big’ job of tackling issues such as Global Warming to the white collared men, whereas we, take up the ‘small’ motto of keep our mountains clean. No, we don’t have t-shirts with slogans like ‘leaving only footprints behind’, and trudging the mountain slopes with a 30-40 men and women having a party in the Himalayas. We operate strictly in small groups, which also enables us for better personalized attention, and finds us in a much better situation to tackle ‘Littering’.\nAs a really ‘small’ entity, we really can’t help the cause any more than doing our part thoroughly. But we hope that helps, somewhere. Cause we really love our mountains, and we always ensure we go that extra mile, or two, to keep it pristine.</p>',frontmatter:{path:"/leave-only-footprints-behind",date:"12 July, 2017",title:"Leave ‘only’ Footprints Behind",type:"blog",address:null}}},{node:{excerpt:"Well-coordinated, timely, cordial and very friendly support.

She can’t save me now…”</p>\n<p>Alpesh was preparing his descent from Junargali Col(16,200 ft), and the immediate danger of slipping and falling in the vast Junargali Glacier engulfed his mind. I was standing 15-20 feet below him in a narrow scree zone, below me was ice slopes of 60-70 degrees, for the next 1500 feet. I knew the slopes aren’t that intimidating as it looks from afar. And I knew Alpesh will find it easier once he takes the plunge and starts descending.</p>\n<p>Padam Singh pointed out the campsite at Shilasamudra, almost 2500 ft below us. Weather was not getting better, members were already feeling the effects of a long day, having already crossed Roopkund and Junargali, mental tiredness was creeping in fast. I knew it will be a long way down.</p>\n<p>Team Altitude started for Roopkund, with 8 members from Kolkata on 10th October, 2013. We reached Lohajung(8,300 ft) on 12th evening. our guide Padam Singh joined us along with 1 cook(Amar Singh) and 4 porters(Gabbar, Kali, Padam &#x26; Harpal). So we became a team of 7 members along with 7 support stuffs(Me and Padam Singh included).</p>\n<p>Clear skies and crisp winds greeted me on the morning of 13th. I always prefer unhurried approach at the start of a trek, and I was quite skeptical about some of our senior members ability to handle the steep ascent to Bedini Bugyal(11,500 ft) in a single day from Wan(8,500 ft), that too after last 3 days continuous journey over train and car. So I decided to break the day into 2 smaller walks. We camped at Ran-Ka-Dhar(9,300 ft) on 13th.</p>\n<p>On the morning of 14th, Mt. Trishul made his first appearance on our north-east corner. We made full use of another glorious day, after last day’s well deserved rest, we made quick progress and reached Bedini just after noon. A fantastic sunset greeted us, when we caught Trishul, Nandaghunti, Chowkhamba, Neelkantha, Hati-Ghori, Bandarpunch….all turning golden, orange and red.</p>\n<p>15th morning was clear, cold and crisp. I caught first sunrays falling on Trishul in my lense, soon the others joined in. We started on the trail toBaguabasa(14,100 ft) after catching a glimpse of Ali bugyal on our way. The steep ascent of Kalu Binayak(14,300 ft) from Pathar Nachuni(12,800 ft) is tiring and relentless. Members of some other groups were grunting about headaches and vomiting tendencies. Thankfully my team members were fit and fine. We reached Baguabasa around 3 pm. It started raining soon after and rains converted to snow flakes soon after. It was -3º C that night.</p>\n<p>We started early on 16th morning. As I said at the start of the write up, this was going to be a long and eventful day. Fresh snow covered our tracks overnight, and progress was a tad difficult. But the cold was immense, and that fastened our movement. We reachedRoopkund(15,700 ft) after 2 hours of steady ascent from Baguabasa. The lake was frozen, fresh snow covered the surroundings, visibility was crystal clear. We performed pujas and took several pictures before making a short but steeper ascent to Junargali Col(16,200 ft).</p>\n<p>View from top was stupendous. Trishul on our north-east was at a stone’s throw distance, Nandaghunti dominated the view on the north, Junargali Glacier lying on our east. The descent was looking ominous but doable. Steep snowy slopes giving in to easier grassy slopes thousand feet below. I sent two of our porters first, they descended easily and quickly with their heavy loads, and due to their heavy loads, it was easier to follow their footsteps. We started descending slowly but steadily with me and Padam Singh at the end of the queue. We reached Shilasamudra(13,150 ft).</p>\n<p>17th Morning was clear once again. West face of Trishul glittering on our east, Trishul glacier on our north-east, Nandaghunti standing tall on north. A herd of Bharals paid a visit to the campsite last evening, they obliged to stay overnight. The team felt fresh after a good night’s sleep. We waited for the sunlight to hit our campsite, started late and still reached Dodang(14,200 ft) around 2 pm.</p>\n<p>For the first time in the week, the mountains greeted us with a grim faced morning on18th. Some members were not feeling well and I sensed we have to move to lower altitudes, sooner the better. Most of the members were not interested to attempt forRonti Saddle(17,100 ft), so I suggested them to leave for Latkhopri, whereas I accompanied 2 of our younger members upto Homekund(15,200 ft).</p>\n<p>Homekund is a very sacred high altitude lake upto which the famous Nandadevi Rajjat Yatra reaches once in  every 12 years. The lake was totally frozen. There was a small temple beside the lake where we performed our prayers. The weather cleared up, we got fantastic views of the saddle. Sadly we could not reach upto there this time. But mountains will wait.</p>\n<p>We descended fast to Dodang, had a quick snack, packed all our belongings, and started the trek towardsLatkhopri(9,500 ft). We met the first party just around Bhujani to distribute the packed lunch we were carrying. we followed the true left bank of Nandakini river into the forest camp of Latkhopri. It started raining mildly after 2 pm and continued till early evening. The campsite was a narrow place surrounded by jungle.</p>\n<p>We made an early start on 19th morning, another long forest walk till we reach Sutol(7, 220 ft). We crossed the beutiful village of Tattad on our way. Lovely fields of Ramdana greeted us as we came nearer to civilization. Reached Sutol around 3 pm, and we thought to give our battered tents a break and instead took shelter in Padam Singh’s in laws’ home! Had a fantastic evening and a sumptuous meal.</p>\n<p>20th morning was bright and warm, and lazy….well as lazy as a trekker can get! We started around 9, bid goodbyes to our generous hosts, proceeded towardsSitel(6,100 ft). The motorable road between Sutol to Sitel is underway for quite some times, and as we passed through its’ many faces of obstacles, I guess it will take some more years. Sitel appeared after 3 hours of steady hiking, where our cars were already waiting.</p>\n<p>We bid goodbye to Padam Singh and his men, not before I ensured the full time has one last meal together, we boarded the car to Karnprayag. After staying there for the night, we went to Haridwar the next day, i.e, 21st, and said goodbye to the mountains.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, we carried/burned all our waste with us from the mountains. Leaving only footprints behind.</p>",frontmatter:{path:"/the-skeleton-lake-roopkund",date:"12 July, 2017",title:"The Skeleton Lake – Roopkund",type:"blog",address:null}}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
