We were on a trek to the remote Sundardunga Valley, organized by Riddha and his team at Altitude, in last October. We had a cracking time ourselves, thanks to Riddha and his team. These guys are the pioneers of how to have fun on a trip to the wild and they plan everything accordingly. Their attention to detail and supreme knowledge of the area really stands out. And I must say there can't be any more capable leader than Riddha, when venturing into the mountains. Thanks to him for making our time a life-changing experience.

Strongly recommend Altitude for anyone planning a Trek or Climb in Indian Himalaya. Looking forward myself to the next trip with you guys!!
