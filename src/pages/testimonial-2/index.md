When monotonous monsoon rain stopped and the sky glittered with the vibrant colored cloud in the afternoon sun, I saw the BAGUABASA Trekker Hut. Hope you guys will arrange another such fantastic trekking program where we can get thrilling memory like rappelling down from Junar Gully Col in knee deep snow.Your logistic support, as well as management skills, were excellent. Though from next time, It will be better option to have 'ready to eat' like food as packed lunch for groups like us, because we surely can't wait for the next adventure with you guys. Hope our original program "Roop Kund-Ronti Saddle" will be organized soon
