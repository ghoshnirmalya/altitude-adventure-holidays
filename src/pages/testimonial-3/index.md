Well-coordinated, timely, cordial and very friendly support. It is important to understand the abilities and exposure to new people venturing into the wild, which these guys do so very well. Great food, entirely safe, flexible with change in plans, supportive. All this and more made it a beautiful and memorable 7-day trip. Thank you, Team Altitude!!
